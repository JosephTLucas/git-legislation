"Qualified production costs" means production costs only to the extent such costs are attributable to the use of tangible property or the performance of services within the state directly and predominantly in the production (including pre-production and post production) of a qualified film, provided, however, that qualified production costs shall not include post production costs unless the portion of the post production costs paid or incurred that is attributable to the use of tangible property or the performance of services in New York in the production of such qualified film equals or exceeds seventy-five percent of the total post production costs spent within and without New York in the production of such qualified film.
